# GNI-per-capita-Developing-countries-vs-Developed

Description

The goal of this project is to create a model that predicts the GNI (Gross National Income) per capita in PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) in developing countries (Latin America) versus developed countries (Europe). 
For this project I used the data from the World Bank Group, more specifically, the data base on World Development Indicators.
I asked myself 3 questions that I wanted to answer within this project: 
```
What are the characteristics most influential towards the GNI per capita ?
```
Are there any differences between developing countries and already developed countries ?
```
What is most influential towards the GNI per capita, Import or Export ?
